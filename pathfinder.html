		<p> Pathfinder is an app that acts a navigation tool for specific rooms and locations within buildings and enclosed locations. The project originally started as a concept for the 2014 CMYK Designathon at UC Berkeley alongside Anna Cheng, Bianca Romulo, and Avery Yoon. Teams were tasked with coming up with solutions to increase accessibility on campus. ALSO DONT U JUST WANNA GET TO YOUR CLASS ON UR FIRST DAY INSTEAD OF BEING LIKE FUCK WHERE IS THSI CLASSROOM IM SWEATY AND I DONT NEED THSI RIGHT NOW</p>

	<div class="twrapleft">
		<p>We had brainstormed several different ideas, each tackling the idea of "accessibility" from a different direction. However, we decided to go with a very simple interpretation that would address an issue near and dear to many students' hearts.</p>

		<p>We confirmed this hypothesis through interviews with other students at the designathon about their experiences finding classroom  on the Berkeley campus. In the majority of interviews, students agreed that finding the building itself was not difficult thanks to online resources and maps available throughout campus.</p> 
		<br>
		<p>However, theses same resources rarely had any details about building interiors and specific classroom locations. Even the maps in the buildings themselves were often said to be difficult to interpret.</p>

	<div class="twrapcenter">
		<p>So like we were time crunch and knew we needed to keep shit streamlined and go for the important bits. STILL we aint shit and wanted to make sure that we delivered a good and coherent product with considerations for future and stuff beyond just school like you put this shit everywhere cause man i care so much about this product u feel</p>

	<div class="twrapleft" style="border: none;">
		<ol>
			<li>Make navigation to classroom simple</li>
			<li>Provide the same, pre existing map resources</li>
			<li>Design with scalability in mind</li>

		<h3>Prototyping</h3>
	</div>

	<br><br>

	<div class="twrapcenter">
		<p>One of the main problems of maps of insides is there are floors so we had to make sure our visuals could convey levels and depth throughout interiors. Wanted to make sure moving through different floors was easily understood while using Pathfinder to navigate through a building. Flip between isometric maps for vertical movement and traditional flat x-y plane maps for single floor navigation. Make sure internal locations were obviously delineated so they can be easily used for landmarks (from user research). </p>
