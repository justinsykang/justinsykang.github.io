	<p>Hello! My name is Justin Kang and I'm a designer. I attended the University of California, Berkeley where I studied cognitive science and am currently the designer for a startup named whitekoat. While I do my best to create great experiences through my work, I try not to take myself too seriously. </p>

	<p>I'm a Southern Californian native currently residing in sometimes rainy, sometimes scorching Sacramento. Among my many loves are food holding more food, bridges and being right on the fucking internet.</p>
